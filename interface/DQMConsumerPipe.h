/**
 * This class is used to manage the subscriptions, DQMevents, and
 * lost connections associated with an DQMevent consumer within the
 * event server part of the storage manager.
 *
 * In this initial version, a consumer is treated as being in one of
 * three states: active, idle, or disconnected. Operationally, these states
 * are meant to indicate the following:
 * - the consumer is alive and requesting events (active)
 * - the consumer has not requested an event in some time, but it is still
 *    connected to the storage manager (idle)
 * - the consumer is no longer connected (disconnected)
 * Since we don't have an actual connection to each consumer, we use
 * various timeouts to decide when the idle and disconnected states
 * should be reported. The logic used is the following:
 * - if ((now - lastEventRequestTime_) > activeTimeout), then
 *   isIdle() will return true. Otherwise, it will return false.
 * - if ((now - lastEventRequestTime_) > (idleTimeout + activeTimeout)), then
 *   isDisconnected() will return true. Otherwise, false.  (In this case,
 *   isIdle() will return false since the consumer has moved from the idle
 *   to the disconnected state.)
 *
 *  Initial Implementation based on Kurt's ConsumerPipe
 *  We can think about a common class later...
