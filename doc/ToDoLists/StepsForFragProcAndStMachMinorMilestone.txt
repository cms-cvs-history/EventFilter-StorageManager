This file contains ideas for the steps that we should take to complete
the "Incorporate FragmentProcessor and state machine into existing code"
task on the task list.  (The completion of this task is called out as
one of our minor milestones with a target completion date of 20-Mar-2009.)

1) eliminate the use of the old JobController and FragmentCollector classes
 -> the worker classes that are passed into these classes need to be
    bundled and passed to the FragmentProcessor (some of them only 
    temporarily).  InitMsgCollection, EventServer, DQMEventServer,
    SMFUSenderList.
 -> we need to group the SM configuration parameters in some sort of
    container or wrapper.  Are these params all infospace entries?
    Do we have a model for wrapping infospace entries already?  (The
    monitoring infospace params may be different than the configuration
    ones [read vs write?].)

2) the work done in the FragmentCollector processXYZ methods needs to
   temporarily be included in EventDistributor::addEventToRelevantQueues.
 -> more details needed

3) add code to StorageManager::fsmCallback to put state machine events
   on the command queue.

4) decide upon, document, and implement the creation of the worker classes
   that we need.
